# Final Project - Easy Shopping

## Include anything else you want to say, such as the difficulties you faced or overcame, the things you learned, what you enjoyed, etc
- I was fuzzy on accessing data in 2D list and converting csv file to 2D list but with referencing back to the book and researching, I was able to understand it better and create a code that works.
- When I first started the project and writing the code, I didn't have the idea of creating a main menu with a list of options that someone can choose from, however, I am really glad that the idea came to me because I like the way my project is much more. 
- I enjoyed making and seeing the code work that asks how many items you want to remove or add and then only removes/adds the number you give. 
- Overall, the project's outcome turned better than I was expecting it to be because I started coming up with new options and ideas as I was working on it.
